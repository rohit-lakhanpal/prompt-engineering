# Prompt Engineering 

## Introduction

This repository contains a tutorial for prompting models GPT-3.5 & GPT-4. But before we dig into that, lets understand a few key concepts.

### What is the Prompt?​

A prompt involves instructions and context passed to a language model to achieve a desired task.​

### What is Prompt Engineering?​

Prompt Engineering is the practice of developing and optimizing prompts to efficiently use language models for a variety of applications. 

### Tokens
